## Hello, World!

My name is Almira and I'm a ui/ux front-end developer. 

Apart from coding, I also maintain a STEM blog - you can find my articles on my webiste at: https://almira.dev/, as well as [Wordpress](https://theartofcoding.org/) and [DEV.to](https://dev.to/maza0w1).

Computer technology is something I have been passionate about for as long as I can remember. I thoroughly relish developing software as a means to express ingenuity and acquire new skill sets and techniques. Within the past few years, I learned several programming languages (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, and some Java) mainly for web, andriod app, and machine learning developments. I wholeheartedly enjoy sharing knowledge as much as I can. So, feel free to contact me if you're in need of support.
