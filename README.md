My name is Almira and I’m a web developer and [STEM blogger](https://theartofcoding.org/).

Computer technology is something I have been passionate about for as long as I can remember. I thoroughly relish developing software as a means to express ingenuity and acquire new skill sets and techniques. Within the past few years, I learned several programming languages (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Python, SQL, and some Java) mainly for web, app, and machine learning developments.

I wholeheartedly enjoy sharing sharing my knowledge and love for technology with others and empowering them to take charge of the future.
